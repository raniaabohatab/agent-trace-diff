# Decisions Log

## 2026-08-11

- **Framework: LangChain.** Most widely used agent framework, verbose/callback-based
  logging exposes step-by-step execution, and its thought → action → observation
  structure maps directly onto the planned-vs-actual comparison this project needs.

- **Model: `claude-haiku-4-5`.** This project only needs a tool-calling loop over 2-3
  deterministic tools for ~15 short test runs — Haiku is fast, cheap (~$1/$5 per MTok),
  and more than capable for that; no reason to pay Sonnet/Opus rates for trace generation.

- **LangChain 1.3.x is a different API than the one the spec assumes.** `pip install
  langchain` pulled in LangChain 1.3.14, whose recommended agent-construction path is
  `langchain.agents.create_agent` (LangGraph-based) — the old `AgentExecutor` /
  `initialize_agent` / `verbose=True` API from the LangChain 0.x docs the spec was
  written against no longer exists as the primary path. Confirmed the actual API by
  inspecting the installed package rather than assuming from memory, per the "pin the
  version, don't debug against a moving target" guidance in the spec's closing notes.
  Pinned exact versions in `requirements.txt`.

- **Console visibility via `agent.stream(..., stream_mode="updates")` + `pretty_print()`**
  instead of `verbose=True`/`StdOutCallbackHandler` — those don't apply to the
  LangGraph-based `create_agent`. This is the 1.x-native equivalent for Day 1's "see
  step-by-step output in console" requirement, and it previews the shape Week 1 Day 3-4's
  trace-capture code will consume (stream steps keyed by node name, each carrying
  `messages`).

- **Tools are fully deterministic/canned** (calculator does real arithmetic locally;
  search and read_file return fixed canned strings) — no real external APIs, so every
  run is repeatable while building the schema and ingestion pipeline, per Day 1 spec.
